    "The database includes a \"buildings\" table with building information retrieved primarily from BBR, and a number of tables comprising types of macrocomponents for different building parts (e.g. a table with all types of external walls, another with all types of roof covers, etc). The linkages between buildings and macrocomponent types are handled by separate tables called \"mapping tables\" (e.g. \"buildings_to_ext_walls\", \"buildings_to_roof_covers\", etc). Each row of a mapping table indicates a building id and a macromponent id corresponding to the building. This allows mapping a building to one or several types of walls, roof covers, etc."
